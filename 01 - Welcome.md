Hey there!

Today we will be learning the basics of Ruby. Ruby is a flexible and dynamic language, developed to feel natural and simple (some even call it beautifulðŸ’Ž). It is open source, and widely popular with the Rails framework.

Today, I'm going to guide you through your first Ruby project. First, we will write a program to output "Hello world" (as software developers are known to do). Then, we will learn some ruby methods to collect user input. Lastly, we will display different statements based on their input.

This is an interactive course, where you will be prompted to do something to finish each step. If it takes more than a few seconds for a response, try refreshing your browser.
